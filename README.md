The Odin Project: Learn Web Dev Google Homepage Challenge
<br>Link to project on The Odin Project: http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css?ref=lnav<br>
<p>I completed this project without 'peeking' at the Google homepage source code. I wanted to reinforce what I am learning/know of CSS and HTML. ;) </p>
<h4>Goal:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Main elements present and placed horizontally</li>
	<li>Navbar across the top with content and position</li>
	<li>Footer, similar to the navbar</li>
</ul>
